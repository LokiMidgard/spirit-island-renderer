# How to contribute

*Thank you for opening this. I'll keep it short.*

- If you have a question or need help, prefere Discussions over issues
- Found a Bug, just open an issue.
- Want a feature implemented and don't know how,
  - *because I never written a program in my life*  
    You can open an issue. But be aware that does not mean I'll implement it.
    I do this in my free time, so I will primarily invest in features
    I think I will need in the feature
  - *because I don't know where to start coding*  
    Open an issue or a draft-pullrequest. If I understand where people
    don't understand the code I can try to correct it, raising the
    code quality.
    

## I want to implement something myself

Thats greate. If it is something small just open a pull request.
But if it will cost you some time it's propably the best to first
check if it will be integrated.

You can just start with a draft pull request describing what you want
to change/add without actually starting with the changes. This will
keep the discussons in one place. But of course you can instead open
an issue or start a discussion if you like that better.

But be aware that I may request some changes, or reject the pullrequest entirely.
There is no guaranty that I will merge your changes.

## Styleguid

### Commits

**Start commit with `?` if they should not appear in the change log**  
The commits will be used to generate the change log. The first line of the commit will be displayed there.
Offten a feateure is not complete with one commit, or some refactoring should be done after that.
Use the `?` to only display important commits.

### Code Style

**Format *your* code**  
I normally format my code before saving. I use the default settings of VS Code.
Please try to format your code before commiting it. This will prevent white space changes
that just make it harder to find what changed later. At least don't make formating
changes in lines you havn't edited anything.

You think something is missing?  
*Open an issue or edit the file yourself and start a pullrequest ;)*
